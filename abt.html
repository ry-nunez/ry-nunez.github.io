      <p class="aboutUs">
        Interval Audio, founded in 2016 by visual artist and curator Troy Dildhar, is a record label
        that specializes in experimental and electronic music made by the underground. All artists,
        no matter how small, are capable of making truly incredible music, and Interval wants to
        give them the platform they deserve. <br /><br />
        Interval Audio is home to hundreds of talented underground artists from all genres and all
        parts of the globe. They've amassed millions of plays on their releases, gotten support from
        popular musicians, and kickstarted the careers of many popular acts in EDM, such as Nimda,
        Akeos, I7, and more. <br /><br />
        Interval Audio currently sports 4 major compilation series for artists to participate in:
        "Elan Vital," "Interval," "Interim," and their most popular: "Without God." All artwork for
        the label is made by Troy himself and carries a unique aesthetic at the crossroads of Y2K,
        Neo-Tokyo, FPS games, and dark fantasy. <br /><br />
        Regardless of the future, Interval Audio will forever be
        <b>within the everlasting interval of nothing and everything.</b>
